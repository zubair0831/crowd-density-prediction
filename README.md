# Crowd Density Prediction for Stampede Prevention

## Overview
This is an ongoing research-oriented project focused on predicting crowd
density to support early warning systems for stampede prevention and
public safety.

## Problem Statement
High crowd density in public spaces can lead to dangerous situations
such as stampedes. Early detection of congestion and risk zones can
help authorities take preventive action.

## Objective
- Estimate crowd density from visual data
- Identify high-risk congestion regions
- Support disaster prevention and public safety

## Approach
- Computer vision–based density estimation
- Machine learning for risk prediction

## Status
🚧 In Progress (Research & Development)

## Technologies
Python, Computer Vision, Machine Learning

## Notes
This project is under active development and will be extended with
model evaluation and experimental results.
